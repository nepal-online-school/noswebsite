# History of Ruby Language

In the own words of Ruby creator, `Matz`, while sending an email message to `ruby-talk` email group,

{% include util/quote.html
    quote="Well, Ruby was born in Feb. 23 1993. At that day, I was talking with my colleague about the possibility of object-oriented scripting language. I knew Perl (Perl4, not Perl5), but I didn’t like it really, because it had smell of toy language (it still has). The object-oriented scripting language seemed very promising. I knew Python then. But I didn’t like it, because I didn’t think it was a true object-oriented language. OO features are appeared to be add-on to the language"

%}

He looked around and not found a language suited for him and decided to create his own. After spending several
months writing an interpreter, he finally published the first public version of Ruby (0.95) to various Japanese
domestic newsgroups in December, 1995.

### Name

_Ruby_ originated during an online chat session between Matsumoto and Keiju Ishitsuka on February 24, 1993, before
any code had been written for the language. Initially two names were proposed: "Coral" and "Ruby". Matsumoto chose
the latter in a later e-mail to Ishitsuka.

### First Appearance

Ruby 0.95 was announced on Japanese domestic newsgroups on December 21, 1995.
